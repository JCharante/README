# README
A directory of my repositories on Github. After five years of this account, stuff starts to pile up. This is a compilation of all my repos so I can reflect back on the memories.

Disclosure: Private repositories for old freelance clients are not listed.

## List of repositories by alphanumerical order

### [a1-gettingstarted](https://github.com/JCharante/a1-gettingstarted)

A repo containing a readme file, I had a class where to submit your homework, you needed to file a PR. So we had to fork their repo and edit our readme, which actually contained information about what we're submitting.

We needed to do a landing page for ourselves. I liked it enough to replace my main page with it (see jcharante.github.io)

### [al](https://github.com/JCharante/al)

(A private repo). Wow I can't believe I found this. Basically a journal written in LaTeX that I last updated in 2017.

### [a2-shortstack](https://github.com/JCharante/a2-shortstack)

A repo containing a readme file, I had a class where to submit your homework, you needed to file a PR. So we had to fork their repo and edit our readme, which actually contained information about what we're submitting.

This is the original version of `triage-spa`

### [a3-persistence](https://github.com/JCharante/a3-persistence)

A repo containing a readme file, I had a class where to submit your homework, you needed to file a PR. So we had to fork their repo and edit our readme, which actually contained information about what we're submitting.

This is the assignment readme for triage-v2, you can read about it way down in this list.

### [a4-creativecoding](https://github.com/JCharante/a4-creativecoding)

A repo containing a readme file, I had a class where to submit your homework, you needed to file a PR. So we had to fork their repo and edit our readme, which actually contained information about what we're submitting.

So for this project, it's a webapp where you entire coutnries you've been to and it creates a 3d globe of polygons where you haven't bene to, because the vertexes are places you've been. The idea is that you'll see that somewhere there is a giant polygon (is it still a polygon if it's drapped of the world?) and that's because you've never been anywhere there. Honestly I had a hard time coming up with an idea for this project where we had to do something with a javascript visualization library. I like the idea behind it though, but it feels a bit classist. 

The source code is at `where-to`.

### [a5-databases-and-components](https://github.com/JCharante/a5-databases-and-components)

A repo containing a readme file, I had a class where to submit your homework, you needed to file a PR. So we had to fork their repo and edit our readme, which actually contained information about what we're submitting.

For this specific project, we needed to port our project to use a different database. Most people were using an SQL DBMS and were challenged to port their software to MongoDB or another NOSQL. Since I was already suing MongoDB, I ported mine to DocumentDB. Thankfully for me, DocumentDB at the time was API compatible with MongoDB, so this readme is just me going "hey so technically nothing changes because you just need to change the environmental variable that hosts the connection string, and I'm not comitting my connection string". I got a 100% on the assignment. While sometimes being a smartass is not beneficial, this let me spend my time on other projects that interested me more and gave me a funny story.

### [BaxterEPCSWeek1](https://github.com/JCharante/BaxterEPCSWeek1)

I think we were trying to teach kids at our school's summer camp to code or something.

### [bb3010](https://github.com/JCharante/bb3010)

A private repo containing the source code for my assignments in BB 3013, I think it's called Simulations in Biology and dealt with agent based modeling in netlogo. It was certainly an interesting class.

### [bookbub](https://github.com/JCharante/bookbub)

A private repo containing the source code for the technical assignment that bookbub assigned me when I applied for their internship program.

### [cos161](https://github.com/JCharante/cos161)

Ah... I took me a second to realize what this was.

So while in High School I took a random java class at a local state university. I found the homework boring because it was too simple. It was a great learning experience though: 

I didn't realize that finals (or was it midterms?) could be outside regularly scheduled hours, so by the time my parents dropped me off at the university was about an hour after the exam had ended. I realized because I saw that the classroom was empty and then I checked my email. I was kind embarassed and didn't feel like catching up on the homework assignments, so I just ghosted the class. Man now I feel bad. My classmates were like regular people, they were cool. Definetely different people than what you find at a private university.

### [cs1102](https://github.com/JCharante/cs1102)

A private repo containing source code for my first class at WPI (for both CS and literally since it met at 8am). It was my first introduction to functional programming. I still don't understand why people decided to write a webapp to control their drone using Haskell (unrelated to this class but related to functional programming).

### [https://github.com/JCharante/cs1102-assignment2](https://github.com/JCharante/cs1102-assignment2)

We had different partners for each assignment so each assignment needed its own access control.

### [cs1102-assignment3](https://github.com/JCharante/cs1102-assignment3)

We had different partners for each assignment so each assignment needed its own access control.

### [CS2011](https://github.com/JCharante/CS2011)

A private repo containing the source code of my solutions for CS 2011, WPI's Machine Organization and Assembly language.

This is one of the hardest classes I've taken, but it's also one that I really enjoyed :)

### [cs2102](https://github.com/JCharante/cs2102)

A private repo containing solns for my java class. I honestly skipped all the lectures because the professor posted the notes ahead of time and I realized that I already knew everything. I was busy taking CS 2011 at the time so an easy class was appreaciated.

### [cs2102-labs](https://github.com/JCharante/cs2102-labs)

So the previous class had "lab" assignments where we if we had a partner we would receive bonus points. I originally worked alone, then I realized that my roommate was partners with our neighbor but my roommate was forced to do all the work, so I took my roommate on as a partner and then I started doing all the work.

### [cs2223](https://github.com/JCharante/cs2223)

A private repo containing the source code for the algorithms class assignments that Professor H. gave out. I took this class while taking Soft Eng and punted this class (ended up getting a C).

### [cs2223-engling](https://github.com/JCharante/cs2223-engling)

A private repo containing the source code for the algorithms class assignments that Professor Engling gave out.

I retook this class the semester after the first time I passed it because I skipped all the lectures the first time because I was busy with a group project. Got an A to replace the C that I got the last time.

### [cs3013](https://github.com/JCharante/cs3013)

A private repo containing the code code for CS 3013, Operating Systems. My homework partner/contributor for this class was the same guy that I worked on yourfinalgrade.com with (I met him through this class). Honestly this was one of the easiest classes that I've ever taken at WPI, but everyone thinks it's really hard which is strange. (If you want me opinion on the hardest class, it's CS 2011 ).

### [cs3733](github.com/JCharante/cs3733)

A private repo containing source code for Software Engineering assignments. 

### [AustinShalit/CS3733-Hospital-Kiosk-Application](https://github.com/AustinShalit/CS3733-Hospital-Kiosk-Application)

So this repo is actually hosted on a teammate's namespace. It's our project from CS 3733, Software Engineering with Professor Wong. It's a hospital kiosk application for a certain hospital in Boston. We got second place at the end (during the first evaluation session we got last place, so it was a big jump in the rankings). 

### [CS3733-Starter-Code](https://github.com/JCharante/CS3733-Starter-Code)

Starter code for CS3733. I just saw that this is 44 commits behind. Kids taking the class these days have it so lucky.

### [CS3733-D19-Team-O-DB-Prototype](https://github.com/JCharante/CS3733-D19-Team-O-DB-Prototype)

A repo containing the database POC for our javafx application.

### [cs4432](github.com/JCharante/cs4432)

A private repo containing the solutions for my homework in WPI's CS 4432 (I think the class is database systems 2, honestly I forgot already).

### [cs525-s20-191w](github.com/JCharante/cs525-s20-191w)

A private repo containing the solutions for my homework in WPI's Information Retrieval and Social Web. 

### [datalab-handout](https://github.com/JCharante/datalab-handout)

No idea why this is its own repo (it's a project from CS 2011).

### [district-one-api](https://github.com/JCharante/district-one-api)

The source code for the API running in google cloud functions that powers District One Stats (formerly frc.gg)

### [district-one-spa](https://github.com/JCharante/district-one-spa)

The source code for the single page application of District One Stats (formerly frc.gg).

### [door-bell](https://github.com/JCharante/door-bell)

Honestly I don't know what this is supposed to be but there's arduino code in this repository. And this is only from two years ago.. Wow I should see a doctor for this memory loss.

### [earth-reverse-engineering](https://github.com/JCharante/earth-reverse-engineering)

This is just a cool project that I forked and didn't touch.

### [ece2010](https://github.com/JCharante/ece2010)

A private repository containing solutions for ECE 2010. I had difficulty with this class because my education prior to this was based on Problem Solving and not practicing memorization, while this class focused on remembering certain formulas and applying them in situations. Basically I was too stubborn to practice. It certainly turned me off from taking future electrical engineering classes, but that's the purpose of a survey class.

### [esperanto-subs](https://github.com/JCharante/esperanto-subs)

A private repo, maybe I should add to it and make it public soon. Basically it's srt files that I created to subtitle content into Esperanto.

### [frc-gg](github.com/JCharante/frc-gg)

A private repo containing scripts for doing database operations on the new version of frc-gg (now named District One Stats)

### [frc.gg.jcharante.com](https://github.com/JCharante/frc.gg.jcharante.com)

The source code for the original 2019 versin of frc.gg

You can view it live here https://s3.amazonaws.com/frc.gg.jcharante.com/index.html# but it's like a 20MB load.

### [feasibility-study](https://github.com/JCharante/feasibility-study)

Now an empty repo. I had a bunch of research here from my capstone project in high school, but I never pushed to remote and then my hard drive failed. Decided to stop working on my capstone and take classes instead. A good lesson to learn while it's not expensive to fial.

### [geolocation-demo](https://github.com/JCharante/geolocation-demo)

Oh hey this actually works! Yeah it's just a simple html page that will display your coordinates using the web api. I think that this was used as a precursor to shout, a project for a hackathon.

### [grades-calculator](https://github.com/JCharante/grades-calculator)

So this is a proof of concept for a final grade calculator. I was actually ignoring my claswork to play around with this, and then I realized that we could totally create a webapp for this as our final project in CS 4241. You make the most progress and are happiest when you can figure out a way to combine a passion with an obligation.

### [hanzi](https://github.com/JCharante/hanzi)

Static files built from the following project, in a repository to take advantage of github pages free hosting.

### [hanzi-spa](https://github.com/JCharante/hanzi-spa)

Source code for the webapp where you can practice typing chinese and see your speed. The list of sentences are pretty limited and I'm pretty sure it'll be DMCA'd eventually so I should rewrite it and add more text.

### [icmi](https://github.com/JCharante/icmi)

A private repo, supposed to be static site generator for my personal site. I kinda ended up just writing a landing page. If I do write a blog I think I'll end up writing it with Quasar SSR, and read some json and write my own vue templates. 

### [ivr](https://github.com/JCharante/ivr)

Okay so this was actually fun. In high school I had a Pavlok (1 & 2) bluetooth wristband where basically it had an API, where you could get it to vibrate or shock (yes, like a non-lethal electrocute) you. So this is the code for a Twilio Interactive Voice Response System, where you call this number, you get asked for what song parody you want to listen to (Yee remixes), and whenever someone called it, I would receive a vibration on my wristband. I had the hotline going for a few months but stopped it after spending $80 on Twilio, because while it wasn't a huge hit at my high school, it blew up at my friend's little brother's middle school.

### [jcharante.com](https://github.com/JCharante/jcharante.com)

The source code for my old landing page

### [jcharante.github.io](github.com/JCharante/jcharante.github.io)

My github pages landing page for my username. I have github pages set so that my domain (jcharante.com) is CNAME'd to this repo. It's just a static site so I think I will keep it to take advantage of the github pages CDN.

### [jinlai](https://github.com/JCharante/jinlai)

A project that I haven't yet started. It's supposed to be the backend for a system that I can use for a universal sign in for my projects. I think I will eventually restart this initiative with a centralized login page.

### [jinlai-vue](https://github.com/JCharante/jinlai-vue)

It's supposed to be a set of vue components that I can use for a universal sign in for my projects, for the previously described repo.

### [ma1022](https://github.com/JCharante/ma1022)

A private repo containing notes from when I took Calc 2 (MA 1022). 

### [nada-answers](https://github.com/JCharante/nada-answers)

So right before taking a train to Boston, this person showed me this silly site that they wasted a bunch of time on. I was kinda shocked in horror with how much time they wasted, so I threw together this POC to replicate the functionality of that site. 

### [notes](https://github.com/JCharante/notes)

A private repo with some notes from classes in high school. 

### [now-github-starter](https://github.com/JCharante/now-github-starter)

Earlier I mentioned that I used to use zeit.co. I think the product that I used was branded as now.sh (not to be confused with hyper.sh). Anyways this is just a template project that I forked.

### [old.frc.gg](https://github.com/JCharante/old.frc.gg)

Honestly I don't know, it's an empty repository with a readme.

### [PBC_Framework](https://github.com/JCharante/PBC_Framework)

Ah it's a whitepaper for a better alternative to Duolingo and Khan Academy. I've since become more cynical and just say that Anki is the solution to everything.

### [ponto](https://github.com/JCharante/ponto)

I got tired of writing a lot of the same code to integrate my shocking bracelet, so I built an API that would forward requests to my bracelet's API. 

### [quotes](https://github.com/JCharante/quotes)

A private repo of markdown files containing quotes i like.

### [schedule](https://github.com/JCharante/schedule)

A project I worked on to help with my high school's requirements. Basically they changed the graduation requirements every year and classes counted differently depending on what year you took them so it was confusing. Never finished it but I started it around the time I showed Willette the This Is Eve Trailer in a room at Salt.

### [shout](https://github.com/JCharante/shout)

My project from the only Hackathon I've done. Basically you need to go to this website to update your location, and then you can text this number. It'll then relay your message to anyone else within a certain distance from you. I wanted to do a centralized geographical groupchat but it was hard to handle updating user's locations without a dedicated app, but for the POC we just did it like this. We won first place in one of the categories but there were only like 2 other teams so we all got first place in a category lol.

### [shout-app](https://github.com/JCharante/shout-app)  

This is just an empty repo? No idea why there's shout and shout-app.

### [sgp1-prox](github.com/JCharante/sgp1-prox)

I have a docker swarm in the region `sgp1`. This docker container/service acts as a nginx reverse proxy, and is able to do so because of Docker Swarm's network routing mesh. It supports TLS and auto redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS. In production, it is behind Cloudflare, and works with their Full (Struct) TLS settings. 

### [snoo-snooze](https://github.com/JCharante/snoo-snooze)

I was trying to quit Reddit so I built a crawler that would scan reddit for new comments or posts from me, and I wore a shocking bracelet (Pavlok) connected to my phone via bluetooth. Whenever the crawler saw activity from me, it would shock me. Unfortunately the crawler wasn't able to be realtime to avoid rate limiting, so it would kick in a few minutes into a reddit session and shock me like 5 times in a row. 

### [speech2face](https://github.com/JCharante/speech2face)

I forked this. I totally forgot what I wanted to do with this.

### [TBAPIv3](https://github.com/JCharante/TBAPIv3)

So this is a fork where I made a modification because I was using it when working on frc.gg and needed to fix a bug in the library. It was fairly trivial to get my changes approved because by complete coincidence the person that wrote this library was going to be my roommate next year so I already had his contact details.

### [Text-to-Image-Synthesis](https://github.com/JCharante/Text-to-Image-Synthesis)

Something I forked, probably because of my high school CS teacher.

### [triage-server-v2](https://github.com/JCharante/triage-server-v2)

The API that corresponds with triage-spa-v2

### [triage-spa](github.com/JCharante/triage-spa)

The original version of the next repo, but with slightly more features because I didn't finish implementing everything in the rewrite. Also there's only one user because as a database it uses a JSON file I think (archaic homework requirement). 

### [triage-spa-v2](github.com/JCharante/triage-spa-v2)

A webapp written over a weekend for a homework assignment. Basically it's a todo list for people who have too much on their plate. You can set two deadlines and other factors which calculate a priority score, and then you're support to work on the task with the highest priority score. Uses mongodb and supports multiple users.

### [vietnamese-text-analyzer](github.com/JCharante/vietnamese-text-analyzer)

A webapp for analyzing vietnamese text documents for English speakers learning Vietnamese. Inspired by chinesetextanalyzer.com

### [web-example](https://github.com/JCharante/web-example)

Oh I totally forgot about this. I was trying to explain and demonstrate how servers worked to an ex. No idea why I bothered creating a requirements.txt file, that seems a little overkill.

### [where-to](https://github.com/JCharante/where-to)

This is the source code for the project described in `a4-___` at the top of this repo.

### [yama](https://github.com/JCharante/yama)

Yet Another Music App

More like, Yet Another mProject aIDidn'tDo (the m and a are silent)

Basically at the time I was using Clementine with a backup to AWS S3 to sync between computers. Occasionally I would export it to my phone, but I realized that it's a pain when you're at the airport and you just realized that you MUST listen to this set on the plane. So originally I thought I'd create an alternative to PLEX, but I ended up just subscribing to Youtube Music.

### [You-Dont-Know-JS](https://github.com/JCharante/You-Dont-Know-JS)

I forgot why I forked this repo but I know that we were supposed to read this book in CS 4241.

### [your-final-grade-api](https://github.com/JCharante/your-final-grade-api)

The API for the following repository

### [your-final-grade-calculator](https://github.com/JCharante/your-final-grade-calculator)

So yourfinalgrade.com actually started out as a final project for a class on websites I guess. I thought it was great but our teacher Charlie was totally unimpressed and emotionless when we presented. Anyways I had worked with my two project partners before and they're awesome, but they didn't really have any experience with creating websites. I usually take the role of PM in my group work, so I split up the work itno creating the Single Page Application, creating the Backend, and creating the npm package that will actually handle taking in a JSON object containing information and grades for a class, and returning the final grades. I assigned both of them to work on the calculator while I focused on the website, and we were short on time so I ended up pumping out the api as well. My regret is that they didn't get to learn about creating websites from this project, but I think they didn't really care and were just happy with the 100% mark that we all received. It's one of my biggest failures from the point of a teammate who is supposed to help my peers learn, but a success from a project perspective.

### [your-final-grade-spa](https://github.com/JCharante/your-final-grade-spa)

The source code for the webapp of yourfinalgrade.com. It's a pretty great Single Page Application (used for calculating your final grade in a class, but you can use it to determine what assignments to punt)

### [zeit-python-demo](https://github.com/JCharante/zeit-python-demo)

So I used to use zeit.co as a host for projects. One of the languages I used to use with it was python. I guess I wanted to create a demo repo at some point but actually didn't do it??
