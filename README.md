# README
A directory of my repositories on Github. After five years of this account, stuff starts to pile up. This is a compilation of all my repos so I can reflect back on the memories.

Disclosure: Private repositories for old freelance clients are not listed.

## List of repositories by alphanumerical order

### [a1-gettingstarted](https://github.com/JCharante/a1-gettingstarted)

A repo containing a readme file, I had a class where to submit your homework, you needed to file a PR. So we had to fork their repo and edit our readme, which actually contained information about what we're submitting.

We needed to do a landing page for ourselves. I liked it enough to replace my main page with it (see jcharante.github.io)

### [https://github.com/JCharante/a2-shortstack](https://github.com/JCharante/a2-shortstack)

A repo containing a readme file, I had a class where to submit your homework, you needed to file a PR. So we had to fork their repo and edit our readme, which actually contained information about what we're submitting.

This is the original version of `triage-spa`

### [a3-persistence](https://github.com/JCharante/a3-persistence)

A repo containing a readme file, I had a class where to submit your homework, you needed to file a PR. So we had to fork their repo and edit our readme, which actually contained information about what we're submitting.

This is the assignment readme for triage-v2, you can read about it way down in this list.

### [a4-creativecoding](https://github.com/JCharante/a4-creativecoding)

A repo containing a readme file, I had a class where to submit your homework, you needed to file a PR. So we had to fork their repo and edit our readme, which actually contained information about what we're submitting.

So for this project, it's a webapp where you entire coutnries you've been to and it creates a 3d globe of polygons where you haven't bene to, because the vertexes are places you've been. The idea is that you'll see that somewhere there is a giant polygon (is it still a polygon if it's drapped of the world?) and that's because you've never been anywhere there. Honestly I had a hard time coming up with an idea for this project where we had to do something with a javascript visualization library. I like the idea behind it though, but it feels a bit classist. 

The source code is at `where-to`.

### [a5-databases-and-components](https://github.com/JCharante/a5-databases-and-components)

A repo containing a readme file, I had a class where to submit your homework, you needed to file a PR. So we had to fork their repo and edit our readme, which actually contained information about what we're submitting.

For this specific project, we needed to port our project to use a different database. Most people were using an SQL DBMS and were challenged to port their software to MongoDB or another NOSQL. Since I was already suing MongoDB, I ported mine to DocumentDB. Thankfully for me, DocumentDB at the time was API compatible with MongoDB, so this readme is just me going "hey so technically nothing changes because you just need to change the environmental variable that hosts the connection string, and I'm not comitting my connection string". I got a 100% on the assignment. While sometimes being a smartass is not beneficial, this let me spend my time on other projects that interested me more and gave me a funny story.

### [bb3010](https://github.com/JCharante/bb3010)

A private repo containing the source code for my assignments in BB 3013, I think it's called Simulations in Biology and dealt with agent based modeling in netlogo. It was certainly an interesting class.

### [bookbub](https://github.com/JCharante/bookbub)

A private repo containing the source code for the technical assignment that bookbub assigned me when I applied for their internship program.

### [cs2223](https://github.com/JCharante/cs2223)

A private repo containing the source code for the algorithms class assignments that Professor H. gave out. I took this class while taking Soft Eng and punted this class (ended up getting a C).

### [cs2223-engling](https://github.com/JCharante/cs2223-engling)

A private repo containing the source code for the algorithms class assignments that Professor Engling gave out.

I retook this class the semester after the first time I passed it because I skipped all the lectures the first time because I was busy with a group project. Got an A to replace the C that I got the last time.

### [cs3013](https://github.com/JCharante/cs3013)

A private repo containing the code code for CS 3013, Operating Systems. My homework partner/contributor for this class was the same guy that I worked on yourfinalgrade.com with (I met him through this class). Honestly this was one of the easiest classes that I've ever taken at WPI, but everyone thinks it's really hard which is strange. (If you want me opinion on the hardest class, it's CS 2011 ).

### [cs3733](github.com/JCharante/cs3733)

A private repo containing source code for Software Engineering assignments. 

### [AustinShalit/CS3733-Hospital-Kiosk-Application](https://github.com/AustinShalit/CS3733-Hospital-Kiosk-Application)

So this repo is actually hosted on a teammate's namespace. It's our project from CS 3733, Software Engineering with Professor Wong. It's a hospital kiosk application for a certain hospital in Boston. We got second place at the end (during the first evaluation session we got last place, so it was a big jump in the rankings). 

### [CS3733-Starter-Code](https://github.com/JCharante/CS3733-Starter-Code)

Starter code for CS3733. I just saw that this is 44 commits behind. Kids taking the class these days have it so lucky.

### [CS3733-D19-Team-O-DB-Prototype](https://github.com/JCharante/CS3733-D19-Team-O-DB-Prototype)

A repo containing the database POC for our javafx application.

### [cs4432](github.com/JCharante/cs4432)

A private repo containing the solutions for my homework in WPI's CS 4432 (I think the class is database systems 2, honestly I forgot already).

### [cs525-s20-191w](github.com/JCharante/cs525-s20-191w)

A private repo containing the solutions for my homework in WPI's Information Retrieval and Social Web. 

### [district-one-api](https://github.com/JCharante/district-one-api)

The source code for the API running in google cloud functions that powers District One Stats (formerly frc.gg)

### [district-one-spa](https://github.com/JCharante/district-one-spa)

The source code for the single page application of District One Stats (formerly frc.gg).

### [ece2010](https://github.com/JCharante/ece2010)

A private repository containing solutions for ECE 2010. I had difficulty with this class because my education prior to this was based on Problem Solving and not practicing memorization, while this class focused on remembering certain formulas and applying them in situations. Basically I was too stubborn to practice. It certainly turned me off from taking future electrical engineering classes, but that's the purpose of a survey class.

### [frc-gg](github.com/JCharante/frc-gg)

A private repo containing scripts for doing database operations on the new version of frc-gg (now named District One Stats)

### [frc.gg.jcharante.com](https://github.com/JCharante/frc.gg.jcharante.com)

The source code for the original 2019 versin of frc.gg

You can view it live here https://s3.amazonaws.com/frc.gg.jcharante.com/index.html# but it's like a 20MB load.

### [grades-calculator](https://github.com/JCharante/grades-calculator)

So this is a proof of concept for a final grade calculator. I was actually ignoring my claswork to play around with this, and then I realized that we could totally create a webapp for this as our final project in CS 4241. You make the most progress and are happiest when you can figure out a way to combine a passion with an obligation.

### [hanzi](https://github.com/JCharante/hanzi)

Static files built from the following project, in a repository to take advantage of github pages free hosting.

### [hanzi-spa](https://github.com/JCharante/hanzi-spa)

Source code for the webapp where you can practice typing chinese and see your speed. The list of sentences are pretty limited and I'm pretty sure it'll be DMCA'd eventually so I should rewrite it and add more text.

### [icmi](https://github.com/JCharante/icmi)

A private repo, supposed to be static site generator for my personal site. I kinda ended up just writing a landing page. If I do write a blog I think I'll end up writing it with Quasar SSR, and read some json and write my own vue templates. 

### [ivr](https://github.com/JCharante/ivr)

Okay so this was actually fun. In high school I had a Pavlok (1 & 2) bluetooth wristband where basically it had an API, where you could get it to vibrate or shock (yes, like a non-lethal electrocute) you. So this is the code for a Twilio Interactive Voice Response System, where you call this number, you get asked for what song parody you want to listen to (Yee remixes), and whenever someone called it, I would receive a vibration on my wristband. I had the hotline going for a few months but stopped it after spending $80 on Twilio, because while it wasn't a huge hit at my high school, it blew up at my friend's little brother's middle school.

### [jcharante.com](https://github.com/JCharante/jcharante.com)

The source code for my old landing page

### [jcharante.github.io](github.com/JCharante/jcharante.github.io)

My github pages landing page for my username. I have github pages set so that my domain (jcharante.com) is CNAME'd to this repo. It's just a static site so I think I will keep it to take advantage of the github pages CDN.

### [jinlai](https://github.com/JCharante/jinlai)

A project that I haven't yet started. It's supposed to be the backend for a system that I can use for a universal sign in for my projects. I think I will eventually restart this initiative with a centralized login page.

### [jinlai-vue](https://github.com/JCharante/jinlai-vue)

It's supposed to be a set of vue components that I can use for a universal sign in for my projects, for the previously described repo.

### [ma1022](https://github.com/JCharante/ma1022)

A private repo containing notes from when I took Calc 2 (MA 1022). 

### [old.frc.gg](https://github.com/JCharante/old.frc.gg)

Honestly I don't know, it's an empty repository with a readme.

### [shout](https://github.com/JCharante/shout)

My project from the only Hackathon I've done. Basically you need to go to this website to update your location, and then you can text this number. It'll then relay your message to anyone else within a certain distance from you. I wanted to do a centralized geographical groupchat but it was hard to handle updating user's locations without a dedicated app, but for the POC we just did it like this. We won first place in one of the categories but there were only like 2 other teams so we all got first place in a category lol.

### [sgp1-prox](github.com/JCharante/sgp1-prox)

I have a docker swarm in the region `sgp1`. This docker container/service acts as a nginx reverse proxy, and is able to do so because of Docker Swarm's network routing mesh. It supports TLS and auto redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS. In production, it is behind Cloudflare, and works with their Full (Struct) TLS settings. 

### [speech2face](https://github.com/JCharante/speech2face)

I forked this. I totally forgot what I wanted to do with this.

### [TBAPIv3](https://github.com/JCharante/TBAPIv3)

So this is a fork where I made a modification because I was using it when working on frc.gg and needed to fix a bug in the library. It was fairly trivial to get my changes approved because by complete coincidence the person that wrote this library was going to be my roommate next year so I already had his contact details.

### [triage-server-v2](https://github.com/JCharante/triage-server-v2)

The API that corresponds with triage-spa-v2

### [triage-spa](github.com/JCharante/triage-spa)

The original version of the next repo, but with slightly more features because I didn't finish implementing everything in the rewrite. Also there's only one user because as a database it uses a JSON file I think (archaic homework requirement). 

### [triage-spa-v2](github.com/JCharante/triage-spa-v2)

A webapp written over a weekend for a homework assignment. Basically it's a todo list for people who have too much on their plate. You can set two deadlines and other factors which calculate a priority score, and then you're support to work on the task with the highest priority score. Uses mongodb and supports multiple users.

### [vietnamese-text-analyzer](github.com/JCharante/vietnamese-text-analyzer)

A webapp for analyzing vietnamese text documents for English speakers learning Vietnamese. Inspired by chinesetextanalyzer.com

### [where-to](https://github.com/JCharante/where-to)

This is the source code for the project described in `a4-___` at the top of this repo.

### [You-Dont-Know-JS](https://github.com/JCharante/You-Dont-Know-JS)

I forgot why I forked this repo but I know that we were supposed to read this book in CS 4241.

### [your-final-grade-api](https://github.com/JCharante/your-final-grade-api)

The API for the following repository

### [your-final-grade-calculator](https://github.com/JCharante/your-final-grade-calculator)

So yourfinalgrade.com actually started out as a final project for a class on websites I guess. I thought it was great but our teacher Charlie was totally unimpressed and emotionless when we presented. Anyways I had worked with my two project partners before and they're awesome, but they didn't really have any experience with creating websites. I usually take the role of PM in my group work, so I split up the work itno creating the Single Page Application, creating the Backend, and creating the npm package that will actually handle taking in a JSON object containing information and grades for a class, and returning the final grades. I assigned both of them to work on the calculator while I focused on the website, and we were short on time so I ended up pumping out the api as well. My regret is that they didn't get to learn about creating websites from this project, but I think they didn't really care and were just happy with the 100% mark that we all received. It's one of my biggest failures from the point of a teammate who is supposed to help my peers learn, but a success from a project perspective.

### [your-final-grade-spa](https://github.com/JCharante/your-final-grade-spa)

The source code for the webapp of yourfinalgrade.com. It's a pretty great Single Page Application (used for calculating your final grade in a class, but you can use it to determine what assignments to punt)
